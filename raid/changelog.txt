1 -> Ideal: Highest possible confidence level to be used for applications demanding the highest possible precision at all times.
1-2 -> Excellent: At this confidence level, positional measurements are considered accurate enough to meet all but the most sensitive applications.
2-5 -> Good: Represents a level that marks the minimum appropriate for making accurate decisions. Positional measurements could be used to make reliable in-route navigation suggestions to the user.

5-10 -> Moderate: Positional measurements could be used for calculations, but the fix quality could still be improved. A more open view of the sky is recommended.
10-20 -> Fair: Represents a low confidence level. Positional measurements should be discarded or used only to indicate a very rough estimate of the current location.
>20 -> Poor: At this level, measurements are inaccurate by as much as 300 meters with a 6-meter accurate device (50 DOP Ã— 6 meters) and should be discarded.
