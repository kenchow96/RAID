These datasets were collected as part of our 30.007 project, and are available as .txt files as well as .kml files (converted from .txt)
The .PNG files aim to give potential users a visualisation of the GPS Waypoints

Hardware:
The GPS Module used was the GY-NEO 6M V2 GPS module w/ Antenna, as in https://www.robot-r-us.com/gps-module/gy-neo-6m-v2-gps-module-w/-antenna.html
The GPS Module was mounted on a Carbon Fibre Frame with 3M Mounting Tape, with direct LoS to the sky

Movement:
The Robot was pushed on a trolley at (hopefully) somewhat constant velocity by me

Software:
The GPS Module was hooked up to a Teensy 3.5 
Initialisation of the GPS module was done with the UBlox Sample Code that can be found on the Arduino Website (https://playground.arduino.cc/UBlox/GPS/)
Parameters were set to: Automotive Mode, 4Hz
GPS messages were parsed with the TinyGPS++ library
(For SUTD_Track_Lane_4_Raw_GPS):
GPS coordinates were logged to a .txt file whenever there was a difference between the currently read coordinate and the last written coordinate
The .txt file resided on a MicroSD Card on the Teensy, should this information be useful
(For SUTD_Track_Outer_Perimeter_Raw_GPS):
GPS coordinates were sent through UART to a Raspberry Pi Zero and uploaded to an IoT Dashboard via a Python Script at intervals of about 1s
Data was formatted and duplicate coordinates were removed in Excel
*it is to be noted that this experiment was conducted in a more haphazard manner, beginning and ending at the Spectator Stand, with intrusions into track lanes and spectator stand area

WARNING:
This is RAW GPS Data, DO NOT use this for any applications that may involve lives
