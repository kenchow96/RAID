These datasets were collected as part of our 30.007 project, and are available as .txt files as well as .kml files (converted from .txt)

Hardware:
The GPS Module used was the GY-NEO 6M V2 GPS module w/ Antenna, as in https://www.robot-r-us.com/gps-module/gy-neo-6m-v2-gps-module-w/-antenna.html
The GPS Module was mounted on a Carbon Fibre Frame with 3M Mounting Tape, with direct LoS to the sky

Movement:
The Robot was pushed on a trolley at (hopefully) somewhat constant velocity by me

Software:
The GPS Module was hooked up to a Teensy 3.5 
Initialisation of the GPS module was done with the UBlox Sample Code that can be found on the Arduino Website (https://playground.arduino.cc/UBlox/GPS/)
Parameters were set to: Automotive Mode, 4Hz
GPS messages were parsed with the TinyGPS++ library
GPS coordinates were logged to a .txt file whenever there was a difference between the currently read coordinate and the last written coordinate
The .txt file resided on a MicroSD Card on the Teensy, should this information be useful

WARNING:
This is RAW GPS Data, DO NOT use this for any applications that may involve lives
